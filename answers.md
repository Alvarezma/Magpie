Start
    "My mother and I talked last night." - responds with "Tell me more about your family"

    "The weather is nice." - responds with "Do you really think so?"
    "Do you know my brother?" - responds with "Why so negative?"
Exercises
    New keywords - New responces
    weather - "I havent ever been outside :("
    you - "I want to talk about you more"
    humans - "I love humans"

    More than one keyword in a string - it is prioritized based on witch key word comes up first on the if - else if chain the first keyword in the chain will always get priority need tpo change order of else if statements to change priority.
Question
    1.  What happens is the program will see keywords inside other words and trigger responces that don't make sense. The program needs to be able to tell if a keywords is a word itself or part of a bigger word to fix this problem.
        Examples - in the word "Know" the program sees "no" and responds "Why so negative?"
